# Manual

(Work in progress )

* To print text use the `say` statement: `say "Hello, World!"`
* Variables can be declared using the `def` statement. Both parameters should be enclosed in a literal, and type-casting will be handled runtime. for instance, `def "abcd" "1234"` will initialize a variable `abcd` with the value of `1234`.
* use the brace notation to concatenate literals with variables: `say "{abcd}HW{abcd}"` evaluates to `say "1234HW1234"`.
