* `say` prints text, as you'd have guessed: `say "Hello, World!"`
* Variables can be declared using the `def` statement. Both parameters must be enclosed in a string literal, and type-casting will be handled runtime. for instance, `def "abcd" "1234"` will initialize a variable `abcd` with the value of `1234`.
* use the brace notation to concatenate literals with variables: `say "{abcd}HW{abcd}"` evaluates to `say "1234HW1234"`.
